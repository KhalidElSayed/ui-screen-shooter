#!/usr/bin/env osascript

(*

Chooses a device type from the iPhone Simulator using menu
selection events.

To use, make sure this file is executable, then run from the terminal:

  bin/choose_sim_device "iPad (Retina)"

Originally, I tried to do this by editing the Preference file for the
simulator, and it worked under Xcode 4.3, but now it ignores those changes
often enough that I chose to use this menu-selection route.

-- START:choose.sim.device
on run argv
  set simType to item 1 of argv

  tell application "iPhone Simulator" to activate
  tell application "System Events"
    tell process "iPhone Simulator"
      tell menu bar 1
        tell menu bar item "Hardware"
          tell menu "Hardware"
            tell menu item "Device"
              tell menu "Device"
                click menu item simType
              end tell
            end tell
          end tell
        end tell
      end tell
    end tell
  end tell
  -- END:choose.sim.device

  -- Need to show the simulator again after changing device,
  -- or else the simulator be hidden when launched by instruments
  -- for some odd reason.
  tell application "System Events"
    set visible of process "iPhone Simulator" to true
  end tell

  -- START:choose.sim.device
end run
-- END:choose.sim.device
